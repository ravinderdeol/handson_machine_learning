* Deep neural networks are simplified versions of the cerebral cortex. They are composed of stacks of layers of artificial neurons.

* Scikit Learn is easy to use and implements many machine learning algorithms efficiently. It is a good entry point to learn machine learning.

* Tensor Flow is a complex library for distributed numerical computation. It makes it possible to train and run large neural networks efficiently by distributing computations across thousands of servers.

* Keras is a high level deep learning API that makes it easy to train and run neural networks.

* Common learning algorithms include Linear And Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Ensemble Methods.

* The majority of problems can be solved using simple techniques like Random Forests or Ensemble Methods.

* Deep learning is suited for complex problems like image recognition, speech recognition, or natural language processing. That is providing you have enough data, computing power, and patience.
